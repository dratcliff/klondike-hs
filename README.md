# klondike

## Notes

This code is admittedly terrible. When I started this exercise, I didn't have much experience with 
functional programming and now I have slightly more. :)

I'm about 1/3 of the way through Haskell Programming from First Principles 
and I thought I might know enough to try to work through this Kata (http://codekata.com/kata/kata20-klondike/).

This program has a lot of flaws, but it's at least to the point that it can solve a randomly generated game 
of the solitaire game Klondike 4-5 times out of 100.
